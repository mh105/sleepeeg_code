EDF De-Indentification Usage Instructions:

1) Click on 'Select File(s)...' button and select .edf file/files from your computer to deidentify.

2) You may choose to either deidentify and overwrite the existing .edf files or deidentify and create a separate copy of the deidentified .edf files.
	
	a) Overwrite EDF : Deidentifies the selected .edf files and overwrites the same .edf with the deidentified information.
	b) Make Copy : Deidentifies the selected EDF files and created a separate copy of the deidentified files with a suffix entered by the user.

3) Please select whether you would like to save the deidentified files as .edf files or as .mat files or as both. Please note that converting and saving the 
   deidentified .edf files to .mat files might take considerable time and occupy a large amount of memory on your device.

4) You may choose to either add suffix to your overwritten deidentified .edf files or copies of your deidentified .edf files by checking the 'add suffix' option. 
   This option is checked by default on choosing to create a copy of the deidentified edf files(step 2b), but need not be used in case of overwriting the existing .edf files(step 2a). 

5) Click on the 'Run' button to start the deidentification. A progress bar indicating the status of the deidentification will appear.

6) On completion, the deidentified files will be in the same folder as the selected .edf files.
